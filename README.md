Solution for Covid-19 pandemic <br>

__Corona Virus outbreak in India__ <br>
A programming based solution for the pandemic is as below:<br>

__The Idea__<br>
>- The idea is to stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.<br>
>- Data can be collected on the behalf of symptoms of COVID-19.<br>
>- Then a machine learning model is trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.<br> 
>- The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity. <br>
>- The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests. <br>

__Machine learning model parameters__  <br>
- A team of doctors can sit down to find out the best model parameters. <br>
- A sample set of such parameters is as follows: <br>

 >__Most common features__  <br>
  >- Fever – continuous <br>
  >- Dry cough – 0/1 <br>
  >- Tiredness – 0/1 <br>

 >__Less common features__  <br>
  >- Aches and Pains – 0/1 <br>
  >- Sore throat – 0/1 <br>
  >- Diarrhoea – 0/1 <br>
  >- Conjunctivitis – 0/1 <br>
  >- Headache – 0/1 <br>
  >- Loss of taste or smell – 0/1 <br>
  >- Rash on skin or discolouration of fingers – 0/1 <br>

 >__Serious features__ 
  >- Difficulty breathing – 0/1 <br>
  >- Chest pain – 0/1 <br>
  >- Loss of speech or movement – 0/1 <br>
 
 __Not all but a few of the above mentioned features are used in this project.__ <br>
